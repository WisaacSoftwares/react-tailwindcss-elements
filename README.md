# Tailwind css custom clases like Bootstrap

In this project I'm trying to recreate "bootstrap like" elements, with some custom css clases with `@layer` and `@apply` by tailwind, to help making elements and controls faster than with vanilla tailwind with **only one simple css file**.

*Work in progress...*
