# Tailwind css custom clases like Bootstrap

In this project, I'm trying to recreate bootstrap-like elements, with some custom CSS classes using tailwind's `@layer` and `@apply`, to help make elements and controls faster compared to vanilla tailwind with **only a simple css** file.

*Work in progress...*

### Finished Work
